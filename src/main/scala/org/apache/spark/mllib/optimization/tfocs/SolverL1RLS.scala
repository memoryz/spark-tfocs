  /**
   * Solves the l1 regularized least squares problem `0.5 * ||A * x' - b||_2^2 + lambda * ||x||_1`
   * using the Spark TFOCS optimizer. This problem is sometimes referred to as lasso linear
   * regression.
   *
   * @param A The design matrix, represented as a DMatrix.
   * @param b The observed values, represented as a DVector.
   * @param lambda The regularization term.
   * @param x0 Initial value of 'x'. A default value will be used if not provided.
   *
   * @return A tuple containing two elements. The first element is a vector containing the optimized
   *         'x' value. The second element contains the objective function history.
   *
   * @see [[org.apache.spark.mllib.optimization.tfocs.examples.TestLASSO]]
   * for example usage of this function.
   *
   * NOTE The distributed matrix 'A', represented as a DMatrix, and the distributed vector 'b',
   * represented as a DVector, must be consistently partitioned. The 'A' matrix must contain the
   * same number of rows in each partition as the 'b' vector has numeric values in the corresponding
   * partition.
   *
   * @see [[org.apache.spark.mllib.optimization.tfocs.VectorSpace]] for more information about the
   * storage formats used by DVector and DMatrix.
   *
   * NOTE In matlab tfocs this functionality is implemented in solver_L1RLS.m.
   * @see [[https://github.com/cvxr/TFOCS/blob/master/solver_L1RLS.m]]
